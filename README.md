This is my first Telegram bot, created for testing and acquaintance with Telegram Bot API. It gives the information about some hotels and provides the opportunity to book suits.
Even though the hotels are real, the information about suits, bookings etc are fake, so the bot must be used ONLY for testing.
From the very beginning I decided not to use any Python libraries that bind to TG Bot API, and you will see here only one library that has something to do with connection to TG server (it's "requests").
